Use clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables

Keep Controllers focused on a single responsibility

Move complex logic into Services, Actions, or Jobs

Use singular Eloquent Models (Player, Game, Club)

All PHP files must end with a blank line

‚öõÔ∏è JavaScript / Vue (or React)
Use camelCase for variables and functions

Avoid global functions and code duplication

Keep components small, modular, and reusable
